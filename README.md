# Multi-attribute-linear-hashing

My implementation for multi-attribute hashing that can be used to produce hashed files that grow as needed and which allow all attributes to contribute to the hash value of each tuple.
It include the functionalities of hashing, inserting, selecting and page spliting.

The following diagram illustrates how choice vector work:
